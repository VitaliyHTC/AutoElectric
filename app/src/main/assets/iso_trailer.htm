<h2>ISO standards for trailer connectors</h1>
<p>A number of ISO standards cover trailer connectors, the electrical connectors between vehicles and the trailers they tow that provide a means of control for the trailers. These are listed below, with notes on significant deviations from them that can cause problems.</p>
<h3>Trailer connectors between the trailer and passenger car, light truck or heavy trucks with 12V systems</h3>
<p>In Europe, both 7-pin (ISO 1724) and 13-pin (ISO 11446) are common. The reason that the 13-pin exists is that the 7-pin is not able to provide all expected services.</p>
<div class="second_text">
<p>These connectors are designed for 12V, but exceptions may exist where both 6V and 24V exists.</p>
<p>Vehicles and trailers with 6V can use the 7-pin or 5-pin connector, but these are rare today. Note that the heavy trucks that may have 12V systems are usually older (Vintage vehicles) or on non-European markets.</p>
<p>The color coding is defined in ISO 4141-3, but the standard color codes are not always followed and may be different on your particular vehicle.</p>

<p>The following supplementary information exists for the connector:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pin 3, 11 and 13 must not be joined in the trailer[4] to avoid interaction between circuit types and over current if one ground pin isn't working.</li>
	<li>Pin 5 and 7 must not be joined in the trailer[4] to avoid problems in vehicles with separate circuits for left and right side.</li>
	<li>Previously allocated to trailer detection in ISO 11446:2002 (the vehicle could detect it was coupled to a trailer using a link between pin 12 and pin 3 in the trailer plug). This function was removed by ISO 11446:2004 and the pin reallocated to reserved. The pin remains reserved for future allocation in ISO 11446-1:2012.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other variants of this connector exists but they are rare.[5] One is used in 24V applications while the other is for ADR use. The difference is how they are mechanically keyed. These connectors are not very common.</p>
<br>
<p><b>7-pin trailer connector Type 12N (ISO 1724)</b></p>
<p>Physical design according to standard ISO 1724.</p>
<p>The 7-pin connector uses on newer trailers all 7 pins according to the ISO standard.</p>
<p>On older trailers there's sometimes a 5-wire setup using a 7-pin connector. In these cases exclude connection for right tail light (58R) and rear fog light (54G) and connect the tail lights only to pin for left tail light (58L).</p>
<p>Joining the pins for right and left tail lights (58R and 58L) can cause problems on German cars where it is possible to activate Standing Lamps on only one side of the vehicle.</p>

<p><i>Pin 2 (54G)</i></p>
<p>According to DIN 72552 pin 54G was initially intended for electrical control of brakes on trailers.</p>
<p>Later pin 2 (54G) has been used for a variety of functions different from the original intent. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>+12V permanent.</li>
	<li>+12V via ignition lock.</li>
	<li>Rear fog lamps.</li>
	<li>Reversing lamps.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why in regions using this connector, trailers on the road are occasionally seen with the rear fog lights on when they should be off. (Vehicle wired for +12V, permanent or via ignition and trailer wired for fog lamps)</p>
<p><i>Special case for Australia</i></p>
<p>Australia uses basically the same wiring with the exception for pin 5 and pin 2. The problematic part here is that pin 5 is used for trailer brake which means that if you for some reason connect an Australian trailer to a towing vehicle with ISO wiring you will get into trouble with the trailer brakes being applied as soon as you turn on the lights.</p>

<h3>Trailer connectors between heavy duty trailer and the tractor unit</h3>
<p>The these connectors are designated as 24 volt.</p>
<p><b>15-pin trailer connector (ISO 12098)</b></p>
<p>Physical design according to standard ISO 12098.</p>
<p>This connector is present on newer heavy duty commercial trucks and trailers following the ISO standard and is intended to replace the combination of connectors according to standards ISO 1185 and ISO 3731. The 15-pin connector is not designed to replace the ISO 7638 connector.</p>
